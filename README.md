# TappyBird
This is a 2d game made in Unity where the goal is to jump through as many obstacles as possible.

As it is against Unity's EULA to post unity assets online, this repository contains only game's source code(under Assets/Scripts) that was written by me as well as project settings files.

NOTE: This game has been made for educational purposes only. Core mechanics and graphics are based on popular game Flappy Bird.
